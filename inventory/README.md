### Advanced Inventory Management System Exercise
An advanced inventory management system tracks products in multiple warehouses and handles product categorization, stock transfers, and reorder thresholds. The system should support detailed reporting for stock levels across all warehouses.

**Features**  
The advanced inventory management system should be able to perform the following operations:

1. **Add Product**: Add a new product with a unique product ID, name, initial stock quantity, category (e.g., electronics, clothing), and associated warehouse.
2. **Update Stock**: Update stock levels for products across multiple warehouses. Adjustments should automatically trigger restocking if the stock falls below a predefined threshold.
3. **Transfer Stock**: Transfer stock of a product between warehouses, ensuring that the transfer is valid.
4. **Check Stock**: Check the stock level for a specific product across all warehouses or within a specific warehouse.
5. **Generate Stock Report**: Generate detailed reports showing the stock levels for all products across all warehouses.
6. **Reorder Products**: Automatically flag products for reorder when stock falls below a specified threshold and initiate restocking procedures.

**Conditions**  
- **Product**:
  - Each product must have a unique product ID and be assigned to a specific category.
  - Products may be stored in multiple warehouses, each with its own stock level.
  
- **Stock Management**:
  - Stock transfers should adjust the stock levels between warehouses appropriately.
  - Reordering should be triggered automatically when stock falls below a certain threshold.
